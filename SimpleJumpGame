// Unity developer platform is needed for this.
// Create empty GameObject and name it Check Ground.
// Overlap this with the ExampleImage that is dragged to Unity.
// Then after this add new Layer named ground.
// Overlap this with the groundimage

Simple Jumping Game Code:

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerControls : MonoBehaviour 
{
	public ExampleImage rb;
	public Transform groundCheck;
	public float groundCheckRadius;
	public LayerMask whatIsGround;
	private bool onGround;

	void Start () {
		
		rb = GetComponent<ExampleImage>();

	}

	void Update () 
	{

		rb.velocity = new Vector2(3, rb.velocity.y);
		onGround = Physics2D.OverlapCircle(groundCheck.position, groundCheckRadius, whatIsGround)		

		if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) && onGround)
		{

			rb.velocity = new Vector2(rb.velocity.x, 3);
	}
}
